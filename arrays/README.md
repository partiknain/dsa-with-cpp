Array problems in C++
Pair sum problem
problem discription
* find two indices in an array such that the numbers at those indices add up to a specific target
* input :An array of integer and a target sum
* output:indices of the two numbers that add up to the target
example:
intput:[2,7,11,15],target=9
output:[0,1],(because 2+7=9)
solution approach
use two pointer approach and find the indices
efficiently find pair sum in O(n) time complexity
