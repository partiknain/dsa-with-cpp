# Reverse a String (Two Pointer Approach)

## Problem Statement
Given a string, reverse it using an efficient **two pointer approach**.

## Approach
1. Initialize two pointers: `start` at the beginning and `end` at the end of the string.  
2. Swap the characters at `start` and `end`.  
3. Move `start` forward and `end` backward.  
4. Repeat until both pointers meet.  

This reverses the string **in-place** without using extra space.

## Key Points
- Efficient and simple  
- In-place reversal (no extra string needed)  
- Common technique in DSA problems

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
